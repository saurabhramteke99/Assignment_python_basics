What is Python, and why is it popular.\n","\n","Ans: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes ease of use, which makes it a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers.\n","\n","Here’s why Python is popular:\n","\n","1.Readability and Simplicity: Python uses a clean and easy-to-understand syntax, making it beginner-friendly. The code is often readable like plain English, which is ideal for those just starting out in programming.\n","\n","2.Large Standard Library: Python has a vast standard library, which means you don’t have to reinvent the wheel when coding common tasks like working with files, making HTTP requests, or handling data.\n","\n","3.Versatility: Python can be used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), automation, scripting, game development, and much more.\n","\n","4.Open-Source: Python is free to use and open-source, which encourages collaboration and growth of the language."],"metadata":{"id":"65CYMwhnAfwe"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_2.   What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans:- In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code directly, line by line. Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java), where code is first translated into machine language (via a compiler) before execution, Python's interpreter processes the code on the fly."],"metadata":{"id":"6CPl7nenCB-2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","\n","Ans: In Python, predefined keywords (also known as reserved words) are words that have a special meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names). These keywords are part of the syntax of the language, and each serves a specific function, so they are reserved for that purpose."],"metadata":{"id":"Y3GFAEwzCgkz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_4. Can keywords be used as variable names.\n","\n","Ans: No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that have a special meaning in the language, and trying to use one as a variable name will result in a syntax error."],"metadata":{"id":"BznsjHXrDJOk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","\n","Ans: In Python, mutability refers to whether or not an object can be changed after it is created. It determines whether an object can be modified in place or if a new object must be created to reflect the changes."],"metadata":{"id":"6wzaSoMVDf01"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_6 Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","\n","Ans: Lists are mutable because they are designed for situations where the data needs to change (e.g., adding, removing, or modifying elements). Tuples are immutable to provide data integrity, ensuring their contents cannot be altered after creation. This makes tuples more efficient for fixed data and allows them to be used as dictionary keys, while lists are better for dynamic data.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"k3AzgNHKEKUb"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_7 What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","\n","Ans: In Python, the == and is operators are used for comparison, but they serve different purposes:\n","\n","A) == (Equality Operator):\n","\n","1)Compares values of two objects to check if they are equal.\n","\n","2)It checks whether the contents or data of the objects are the same.\n","\n","B)  is (Identity Operator):\n","\n","1)Compares the memory addresses (identity) of two objects to check if they are the same object.\n","\n","2)It checks whether both variables point to the exact same object in memory, not just if they have the same value.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Cg5sb2uHE1FD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_8  What are logical operators in Python ?\n","\n","Ans: In Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements or expressions. They operate on boolean values (True or False) and return a boolean result. The three primary logical operators are:\n","\n","1) and: Returns True if both conditions are True.\n","\n","2) or: Returns True if at least one condition is True.\n","\n","3) not: Reverses the boolean value (True to False, False to True).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MYrQLr5rGBN1"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_9 What is type casting in Python ?\n","\n","Ans: Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type into another. It allows you to change the type of a value to suit your needs. There are two main types of type casting:\n","\n","Implicit Casting (Automatic): Python automatically converts one data type to another when needed, usually when converting from a smaller type to a larger one.\n","\n","Explicit Casting (Manual): You manually convert a value from one type to another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_jJX1LThG6D-"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_10 What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n","\n","Ans: A)Implicit Type Casting (Automatic):\n","\n","\n","1)Performed by Python automatically.\n","\n","2)Happens when converting from a smaller data type to a larger data type (e.g., int to float).\n","\n","3)No explicit action is required by the programmer.\n","\n","4)Safe because no data is lost in the conversion.\n","\n","\n","B)Explicit Type Casting (Manual):\n","\n","\n","1)Performed by the programmer using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n","\n","2)Programmer manually converts one data type to another.\n","\n","3)Can result in data loss or errors if not done correctly (e.g., converting a string to an integer).\n","\n","4)Requires explicit function calls for conversion.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ffWaki5HHjj_"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_11  What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n","Ans: The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions and control the flow of execution based on certain conditions. These statements enable the program to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.\n","\n","Key Purposes:\n","1)Control Flow: Conditional statements help to guide the flow of the program by determining which code block should be executed based on a condition.\n","\n","2)Decision Making: They allow the program to perform actions based on specific conditions or inputs.\n","\n","3)Handling Different Scenarios: Conditional statements enable the program to react differently to various situations, making the program dynamic and flexible."],"metadata":{"id":"snteHmjaJZ39"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_12  How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","Ans: The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence after an initial if statement. It allows you to test several conditions and execute the corresponding block of code for the first condition that is True. If none of the if or elif conditions are True, the else block (if present) will be executed.\n","\n","How elif works:\n","\n","\n","1)Starts after an if statement: The elif statement follows an if block to check additional conditions if the if condition is False.\n","\n","2)Evaluates conditions sequentially: If the if condition is False, the program moves to check the elif condition(s). The first True condition will execute its associated block of code.\n","\n","3)Multiple elif statements: You can have multiple elif conditions to check several possibilities."],"metadata":{"id":"lwHR5NZqKMxG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_13 What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","\n","Ans: 1) for loop:\n","\n","\n","a)Used for iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) a specific number of times.\n","\n","b)It is typically used when the number of iterations is known or predefined.\n","\n","c)The loop variable takes values from the sequence one by one.\n","\n","2) while loop:\n","\n","a)Used for repeating a block of code while a condition is True.\n","\n","b)It is typically used when the number of iterations is not predetermined, and the loop continues until a specific condition becomes False.\n","\n","c)The condition is checked before each iteration."],"metadata":{"id":"EV2ylvtBLJ1F"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Que_14  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","Ans: A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition being met.\n","\n","Example: Continuously prompt the user for valid input until they provide a correct response.\n","\n","\n","user_input = None\n","\n","\n","while user_input != \"yes\":\n","\n","\n","    user_input = input(\"Do you want to continue?
